# Feature Specification: PRD Summary and Core Requirements

**Feature Branch**: `001-read-the-prd`
**Created**: September 17, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "read the PRD from @prd_game_test_framework.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A QA Engineer needs to validate a new game build. They use the GETAF to execute a suite of automated tests (unit, integration, and system-level performance tests) against the build. The framework runs the tests, collects performance metrics, compares them against a baseline, and stores the results in a database. The engineer then reviews a report to quickly identify any functional regressions or performance degradation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new game build is ready for testing, **When** the QA engineer triggers the CI/CD pipeline, **Then** the framework automatically executes all test suites and generates a results report.
2. **Given** a performance test is running, **When** the game's FPS drops below the configured baseline threshold, **Then** the final report MUST flag a performance regression.
3. **Given** a test configuration file (XML/JSON) is defined, **When** the test runner is executed, **Then** the tests are parameterized with the data from the configuration file.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a test crashes or hangs? The framework should timeout and log the failure without halting the entire test run.
- How does the system handle an invalid test configuration file? The system should report a clear error and fail the test run.
- What happens if the database connection is lost during result logging? The framework should cache results to a local file and attempt to re-establish the connection. It will retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 30s). If it still fails, the cached results are kept for the next successful run. The local cache is limited to 100MB.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a multi-layer testing pyramid (Unit, Integration, System).
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure seamless integration between the C++ core and C# scripting layer.
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable data-driven test execution from XML/JSON configuration files.
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate natively with UE5's automation systems (Gauntlet).
- **FR-005**: System MUST achieve comprehensive test coverage of implemented game features (Character, AI, UI, etc.).
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement real-time collection of performance metrics (FPS, memory).
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically detect performance regressions against a defined baseline.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a framework for testing HTTP REST APIs.
- **FR-009**: System MUST test database connectivity and data integrity.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Execution**: Represents a single run of the entire test suite.
- **Test Result**: Represents the outcome of an individual test case (e.g., pass, fail, skipped). Attributes include test name, duration, and error messages.
- **Performance Metric**: Represents a single performance measurement (e.g., FPS, memory usage) at a point in time.
- **Performance Baseline**: Represents the expected performance metrics for a given test scenario, used for regression detection.
- **Test Configuration**: Represents the parameters and data used to drive data-driven tests.
