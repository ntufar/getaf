# API Contracts

This directory contains the API contracts for services used or exposed by the GETAF project.

The primary API to be tested is a hypothetical game service API, for which contracts would be defined here in a format like OpenAPI 3.0.

For the purpose of this feature, this directory serves as a placeholder for where those contracts would be managed.
